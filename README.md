#Professional Portfolio

## Description
This application will be a compliation of projects I've completed and are in the process of updating.  They will be personal projects as well as those completed in the course of the OSU bootcamp.   

## Usage
This portfolio will be used to showcase aquired skills via work samples for potential employers.  It (ideally) will be updated as our knowledge set grows.
